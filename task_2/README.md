# CI/CD Pipeline Design

## Design a CI/CD pipeline for an application in an AWS-based environment using Jenkins. The pipeline will:

#### 1. Lint code and run unit tests on commits.

#### 2. Build a Docker image and push it to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR).

#### 3. Deploy the Docker container to an AWS ECS cluster.

### Pipeline Stages
Code Checkout:

> Pull the latest code from the source code repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).

Linting and Unit Testing:

> Run a linter (e.g., ESLint, Pylint) to ensure code quality.

> Execute unit tests using a testing framework (e.g., Jest, PyTest).

Build Docker Image:

> Build a Docker image from the application code.

Push Docker Image to AWS ECR:

> Authenticate with AWS ECR.

> Tag and push the Docker image to the ECR repository.

Deploy to AWS ECS:

> Update the ECS service to use the new Docker image.
